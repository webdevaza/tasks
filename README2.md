## Let's first plan everything:

1) Create all the necessary views:
    - tasks page:
        * create tasks input --> OK
        * list --> OK
        * edit tasks input --> OK
        * add datePicker --> OK
    - welcome page:
        * navbar --> OK
        * body --> OK
        * footer --> OK
    - admin panel
        * users list --> CANCEL
        * edit user part --> CANCEL

2) Edit existing views:
    - dashboard --> OK
    - register --> OK
    - login --> OK
    - profile --> OK
    - make details better --> OK

3) Models & controllers:
    - TasksModel & TasksController --> OK

4) Auth middlewares:
    - add them to routes --> OK

5) Migrations:
    - create_task_table --> OK

6) Seeders:
    - seed tasks --> CANCEL
    - seed users --> CANCEL

7) Feature tests:
    - UserController test --> it was already written by default
    - TasksController test --> it should be finished very soon
